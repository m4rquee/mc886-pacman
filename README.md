# Pacman Contest for Python 3

This repo contains the code for running a single Capture the Flag game, as per [CS188 UC Berkley Implementation](http://ai.berkeley.edu/contest.html). It serves as a module for the [Pacman Contest Cluster](https://github.com/AI4EDUC/pacman-contest-cluster) system that runs an all-against-all tournament using a cluster of machines/CPUs.

While the original code runs on Python 2.7, **this version runs on Python 3.x**. It also has a few bugs fixing (see issue tracking). 

We are thankful to the CS188 teaching staff at UC Berkley for sharing this wonderful project with the community.
